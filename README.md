It works as an MCP adapter for any MCP-compatible AI client, making your site agent-ready out of the box.

No Node.js. No external proxy. No complicated setup. Just install, generate a token, and start building.

---

## One-Click Connect with OAuth 2.0/2.1

Skip manual token copy-paste. Your **WordPress MCP** endpoint ships with a full **OAuth 2.0/2.1** authorization server — PKCE, refresh-token rotation, and Dynamic Client Registration (RFC 7591) built in. Compatible MCP clients like Claude Desktop can connect with a single click: they register themselves, you approve the scopes on a consent screen, and you're done. Bearer tokens still work for power users and automation.

---

## Built for Security

Giving an AI access to your site is serious — so security is built into every layer:

- **Bearer token authentication** with SHA-256 hashing — the raw token is never stored
- **Per-token permissions** — create a read-only token for one AI, a full-access token for another
- **WordPress capability checks** on every single tool call
- **Rate limiting** per token (default 60 requests/min, configurable)
- **Full audit trail** — every tool call is logged with token used, arguments, result, and client IP
- **IP whitelisting** — optionally restrict which IPs can use the MCP endpoint

---

## Simple Admin Interface

- **Dashboard** — your MCP endpoint URL and one-click connection configs for every major AI client
- **API Tokens** — create and manage tokens with a checkbox-based tool permission tree
- **Audit Log** — a paginated, searchable log of every AI action taken on your site
- **Change History** — a dedicated page with before/after snapshots of every MCP-originated write, inline diff expand, and user / object / date filtering
- **Settings** — tune rate limits, audit and change-history retention, IP whitelist, and more

---

## Installation

### Automatic (recommended)

1. In your WordPress admin, go to **Plugins → Add New Plugin**
2. Search for **"Easy MCP AI"**
3. Click **Install Now** and then **Activate**

### Manual

1. Download the plugin ZIP from the WordPress plugin directory
2. Go to **Plugins → Add New Plugin → Upload Plugin**
3. Upload the ZIP, click **Install Now**, then **Activate**

---

## Quick Start — Connect Your AI

### Path A — One-Click OAuth (recommended)

1. Go to **Easy MCP AI → Dashboard** and copy your MCP server URL
2. In your AI client (e.g. Claude Desktop → Settings → Connectors → Add custom connector), paste the URL — no token needed
3. Your browser opens a WordPress login + consent screen. Sign in as the user the AI should act as
4. Tick the permission categories you want to grant, then **Approve**
5. Done. Start talking to your site
6. Manage or revoke connected clients anytime under **Easy MCP AI → API Token & OAuth → OAuth** tab

### Path B — Manual Bearer Token

1. Go to **Easy MCP AI → API Tokens** and click **Create New Token**
2. Give the token a name, choose the WordPress user the AI will act as, and select which tools to allow
3. Click **Create Token** and copy the token — it is only shown once
4. In your AI assistant, paste in the endpoint URL and token from the Dashboard page
5. Start talking to your site

### Claude Code (claude.ai/code or CLI)

Add to your `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "my-wordpress": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://yourdomain.com/wp-json/easy-mcp-ai/v1/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## External Services

This plugin connects to the following third-party services **only when a site administrator explicitly configures their own external account credentials** in **Easy MCP AI → External Data**. Nothing is contacted on a default install.

| Service | Endpoint | When Used |
|---|---|---|
| **Semrush API** | `api.semrush.com` | Only if an admin saves a Semrush API key |
| **DataForSEO** | `api.dataforseo.com` | Only if an admin saves a DataForSEO login + API password |
| **Google Analytics 4** | `analyticsdata.googleapis.com` | Only if an admin uploads a Google service-account JSON |
| **Google Search Console** | `searchconsole.googleapis.com` | Only if an admin uploads a Google service-account JSON |

All credentials are stored AES-256-GCM encrypted with per-provider HKDF-derived keys. Nothing is sent to any third party until an AI actually calls a tool that needs it.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What is Easy MCP AI?**  
Easy MCP AI is a free WordPress AI connector that turns your site into a remote MCP server. Once activated, any MCP-compatible AI assistant — Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, Gemini AI, n8n — can read and write content, manage media, users, and settings, and pull SEO and analytics data through 233 ready-to-use tools. No Node.js, no proxy, no extra hosting.

**Is this a WordPress MCP server?**  
Yes. Easy MCP AI implements the Model Context Protocol spec (v2025-11-25, with backwards compatibility for v2025-06-18 and v2025-03-26) directly inside WordPress. Your site exposes a single MCP endpoint at `/wp-json/easy-mcp-ai/v1/mcp`.

**What is the Model Context Protocol (MCP)?**  
MCP is an open standard created by Anthropic that lets AI assistants securely connect to external tools and data sources. It's the universal protocol for AI-to-app communication, supported by Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, and dozens of other platforms. Learn more at [modelcontextprotocol.io](https://modelcontextprotocol.io).

**Does this plugin send my content to OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google?**  
No. Easy MCP AI does not call any AI provider. The flow is the opposite: your AI assistant calls your WordPress site, and the plugin executes whatever tool the AI requested. Your content only leaves your server in the response that goes back to the AI client you connected.

**Is Easy MCP AI free?**  
Yes. This WordPress MCP plugin is free and open source on the WordPress.org plugin directory. There are no paid tiers, no usage limits, and no telemetry. Optional external integrations (Semrush, DataForSEO, Google Analytics, Search Console) use your own third-party accounts.

**How does authentication work?**  
Two options:
1. **OAuth 2.0/2.1 one-click connect** (recommended) — open your AI client, paste your MCP URL, sign in to WordPress, approve the consent screen
2. **Manual Bearer token** — create a token under Easy MCP AI → API Tokens, paste it into your AI client

Every token (OAuth or Bearer) is SHA-256 hashed before being saved — the raw value is never stored.

**Can I control what the AI is allowed to do?**  
Yes, fully. Each token has its own permission set — you choose exactly which tools it can call. Permissions are also enforced at the WordPress capability level, so the AI inherits exactly the capabilities of the WordPress user the token is bound to.

**Will the AI publish posts automatically?**  
Only if you let it. Enable **Force Draft on Create** under Easy MCP AI → Settings and every newly created post or page will be forced to `draft` regardless of what the AI requested.

**Does it work with WordPress multisite?**  
Yes. Easy MCP AI runs per-site on a multisite network — each subsite has its own MCP endpoint, its own tokens, and its own audit log.

**Does it work on localhost?**  
Yes. On loopback addresses (`127.0.0.1`, `::1`) the OAuth HTTPS requirement is automatically relaxed so you can test against `http://localhost`.

**Why does the endpoint return 404?**  
Go to **Settings → Permalinks** and click **Save Changes** to flush rewrite rules. Pretty permalinks must be enabled.

**Where do I report security bugs?**  
Please report security bugs through the [Patchstack Vulnerability Disclosure Program](https://patchstack.com/database/vdp/8e5e1a2e-1cd4-42d7-8a5d-9ff3d1a7f397).
