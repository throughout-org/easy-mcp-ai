## [2.0.0] — 2026-06-12

### Added — Phase 3: AEO (Answer Engine Optimisation)

**`wp_get_faq_blocks`** `readonly`  
Extracts all FAQ and Q&A blocks from a post. Detects:
- Yoast FAQ blocks (`<!-- wp:yoast/faq-block -->`)
- Rank Math FAQ blocks (`<!-- wp:rank-math/faq-block -->`)
- Inline `FAQPage` JSON-LD already embedded in content
- Generic HTML `<details>/<summary>` patterns

Returns `{ faq_count, source_counts, faqs: [{ source, question, answer }] }`.

**`wp_create_faq_block`** `write`  
Appends (or prepends) a Yoast-compatible FAQ block to a post and simultaneously saves a `FAQPage` JSON-LD schema to `_easy_mcp_schema` post meta so it renders in `<head>`. Merges with existing FAQPage schemas instead of overwriting. Parameters: `post_id`, `faqs: [{ question, answer }]`, `append` (default `true`).

**`wp_audit_answer_readiness`** `readonly`  
Scores published posts out of 100 for Answer Engine Optimisation (featured snippets, "People also ask"). Rubric:
| Signal | Points |
|---|---|
| FAQ / Q&A content | 25 |
| Concise opening paragraph (≤ 55 words) | 20 |
| Title phrased as a question | 20 |
| H2/H3 headings phrased as questions | 20 |
| Bullet or numbered lists | 15 |

Returns per-post scores, grades (A–F), `quick_wins` suggestions, and a site average.

---

### Added — Phase 4: E-E-A-T / HEO (Human Experience Optimisation)

**`wp_get_eeat_signals`** `readonly`  
Full E-E-A-T audit for a single post (100-point scale):
| Dimension | Signal | Points |
|---|---|---|
| Experience | Author bio ≥ 30 chars | 20 |
| Experience | Author social / website links | 15 |
| Expertise | Author entity in JSON-LD schema | 15 |
| Authoritativeness | Outbound citations ≥ 2 | 15 |
| Trustworthiness | Content updated within 12 months | 20 |
| Trustworthiness | Structured data present | 15 |

Returns per-dimension scores, detailed signal breakdown, and actionable recommendations.

**`wp_get_content_freshness`** `readonly`  
Lists published posts that have not been updated within a configurable number of days (default: 180), sorted by staleness oldest-first. Use this to find content that needs a freshness review to maintain E-E-A-T signals.  
Parameters: `post_type`, `days`, `limit`, `offset`.

**`wp_get_internal_links`** `readonly`  
Lists every internal link within a post's content, resolved to the target post ID, title, and status. Useful for auditing link equity, finding broken internal links, and spotting orphaned content.

**`wp_suggest_internal_links`** `readonly`  
Finds related posts that (a) should link **to** the given post, or (b) the given post should link **to**. Matches by shared taxonomy terms and title/content word overlap. Returns suggestions scored by relevance, never modifies content.

### Added — Phase 5: Reporting & Aggregation

- `schema_coverage_pct` — % of posts with JSON-LD structured data
- `missing_seo_title` / `missing_meta_desc` — count of posts lacking SEO meta
- `stale_content_count` — posts not updated in 12+ months
- `author_bio_pct` — % of posts whose author has a bio
- `aeo_ready_count` / `aeo_ready_pct` — posts with FAQ/Q&A content
- `geo_ready_count` / `geo_ready_pct` — posts with schema + headings + 300+ words
- `avg_eeat_score` — average E-E-A-T score (0–100)
- `eeat_grade_distribution` — breakdown of grades A through F
- `top_issues` — most common problems sorted by frequency
- `fix_priority` — ranked list of the 5 highest-impact fixes

**`wp_content_gap_report`** `readonly`  
Compares a list of target topics/keywords against all published posts to surface content gaps. Scores each post's relevance to each topic by matching title words, category names, and tag names. Returns `covered` topics with their best-matching post, `gaps` with closest match scores, and a `coverage_pct`.  
Parameters: `topics` (array, required), `post_type`, `threshold` (0–100, default 30).
