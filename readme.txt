Connect Claude, ChatGPT & any AI to WordPress. Manage your entire site by chat — content, media, GA4, Search Console, SEO, GEO, AEO, E-E-A-T & more. 233 tools. Free.

== Description ==

[**Easy MCP AI**](https://easymcpai.com/) is the most complete **free WordPress MCP server** — a remote MCP server built so AI assistants and autonomous AI agents can run your entire site workflow, from content and publishing to SEO research, traffic monitoring, and daily admin, through the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io). It works as an MCP adapter for any MCP-compatible AI client, making your site agent-ready out of the box. Ask your AI about Google Analytics, Google Search Console, and SEO data without leaving your chat. You bring the direction. Your AI handles the execution.

No Node.js. No external proxy. No complicated setup. Just install, generate a token, and start building.

**At a glance:**

* **233 tools** across posts, pages, media, users, comments, menus, Google Analytics 4, Google Search Console, Semrush, DataforSEO, SEO/GEO/AEO/E-E-A-T, filesystem, database, and more

= 3 Change History Tools =

**wp_history_list** — query change records by user, object type, object id, tool name, or date range; supports `since` / `until` filters and pagination
**wp_history_get** — fetch a single change record with full before/after JSON snapshots
**wp_history_diff** — compute a structured diff between any recorded snapshot and either another snapshot or the current live state of the object

Non-admin tokens see only their own changes. Administrators (with the new `easy_mcp_ai_view_all_history` capability — granted to the Administrator role on activation) see every user's changes. Sensitive keys are redacted before storage, sensitive post meta keys (matching patterns like `*_token`, `*_secret`, `*password*`, `*api_key*`) are redacted at write time, and snapshot size is capped. The `wp_history_diff` tool also enforces these gates when reading the *current* live state: meta requires `edit_post`, options require `manage_options`, and protected meta keys are excluded entirely. Site owners can narrow query scope further via the `easy_mcp_ai_history_query_scope` filter (the self-pin for non-admins cannot be weakened by the filter).

= Connect Any Plugin with Abilities API =

WordPress 6.9+ introduces **Abilities API** — a standard way for plugins to declare what they can do. Easy MCP AI acts as an **MCP adapter** for any plugin that registers Abilities — automatically discovering and exposing them as MCP tools with no custom code needed. If a plugin supports the Abilities API, your AI can use it out of the box.

= One-Click Connect with OAuth 2.0/2.1 =

Skip manual token copy-paste. Your **WordPress MCP** endpoint ships with a full **OAuth 2.0/2.1** authorization server — PKCE, refresh-token rotation, and Dynamic Client Registration (RFC 7591) built in. Compatible MCP clients like Claude Desktop can connect with a single click: they register themselves, you approve the scopes on a consent screen, and you're done. Bearer tokens still work for power users and automation.

= Built for Security =

Giving an AI access to your site is serious — so security is built into every layer:

* **Bearer token authentication** with SHA-256 hashing — the raw token is never stored
* **Per-token permissions** — create a read-only token for one AI, a full-access token for another
* **WordPress capability checks** on every single tool call
* **Rate limiting** per token (default 60 requests/min, configurable)
* **Full audit trail** — every tool call is logged in a searchable user activity log with the token used, arguments, result, and client IP
* **IP whitelisting** — optionally restrict which IPs can use the MCP endpoint

= Simple Admin Interface =

* **Dashboard** — your MCP endpoint URL and one-click connection configs for every major AI client
* **API Tokens** — create and manage tokens with a checkbox-based tool permission tree
* **Audit Log** — a paginated, searchable user activity log of every AI action taken on your site
* **Change History** — a dedicated page with before/after snapshots of every MCP-originated write, inline diff expand, and user / object / date filtering
* **Settings** — tune rate limits, audit and change-history retention, IP whitelist, and more

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is Easy MCP AI? =

Easy MCP AI is a free **WordPress AI connector** that turns your site into a remote **MCP (Model Context Protocol) server**. Once activated, any MCP-compatible AI assistant or AI agent — Claude (Anthropic), ChatGPT (OpenAI), Cursor, Gemini AI, n8n, and more — can read and write content, manage media, users, and settings, and pull SEO and analytics data through 204 ready-to-use tools. No Node.js, no proxy, no extra hosting.

= Is this a WordPress MCP server? =

Yes. Easy MCP AI acts as a **WordPress MCP adapter** — a full MCP server implementing the Model Context Protocol spec (v2025-11-25, with backwards compatibility for v2025-06-18 and v2025-03-26) directly inside WordPress. Your site exposes a single MCP endpoint at `/wp-json/easy-mcp-ai/v1/mcp` that any MCP client can connect to over HTTPS.

= What is the Model Context Protocol (MCP)? =

MCP is an open standard created by Anthropic that lets AI assistants and AI agents securely connect to external tools and data sources. It's quickly becoming the universal protocol for AI-to-app communication, supported by Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, and dozens of other platforms. Learn more at [modelcontextprotocol.io](https://modelcontextprotocol.io).

= How is Easy MCP AI different from other WordPress AI plugins? =

Most WordPress AI plugins embed a single AI provider (OpenAI, Claude, etc.) inside the wp-admin and bill you for usage. Easy MCP AI does the opposite — it makes your WordPress site an agent-ready backend that **any** AI assistant can connect to over MCP. You bring your own AI client, you bring your own model, and the plugin focuses on giving that AI safe, scoped access to your site: 214 tools, OAuth 2.0/2.1 one-click connect, per-token permissions, and a full audit trail.

= Is Easy MCP AI free? =

Yes. This **WordPress MCP** plugin is free and open source on the WordPress.org plugin directory. There are no paid tiers, no usage limits, and no telemetry. Optional external integrations (Semrush, DataForSEO, Google Analytics, Search Console) use **your own** third-party accounts — Easy MCP AI never bills you for API usage.

= How do I connect Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, Gemini, or n8n to my WordPress site? =

After activation, go to **Easy MCP AI → Dashboard** and copy your MCP server URL. Then:

* **Claude Desktop / Claude.ai / Claude Code** (by Anthropic) — Settings → Connectors → Add custom connector, paste the URL, approve the OAuth consent screen. One click, no token.
* **ChatGPT (OpenAI)** — add as an MCP server using the same URL.
* **Cursor / Windsurf / Cline / Roo Code** — add MCP server in the client's settings using the URL.
* **Gemini AI** (Gemini CLI / Google Antigravity) — register the MCP endpoint in the client config.
* **n8n** — use the MCP node and point it at the URL plus a Bearer token created under **Easy MCP AI → API Tokens**.

See the [integrations page](https://easymcpai.com/integrations) for step-by-step guides per client.

= Does it work with WooCommerce, Yoast, Rank Math, ACF, BuddyPress, and The Events Calendar? =

Yes. Easy MCP AI ships with first-party WooCommerce AI tool sets: **WooCommerce** (46 tools — products, orders, customers, coupons, reports, shipping, webhooks), **Advanced Custom Fields (ACF)** (6 tools to get and update ACF fields and ACF field groups on posts, users, and terms), **The Events Calendar** (10 tools), **BuddyPress** (10 tools), **Yoast SEO**, **Rank Math**, and **All in One SEO (AIOSEO)**. Each integration only loads if the underlying plugin is active, and each tool group can be toggled individually under **Easy MCP AI → Plugin Integrations**.

= Can I use Easy MCP AI as an AI writing assistant for WordPress? =

Yes. Once connected, your AI acts as a writing assistant for WordPress — drafting posts, editing existing content, updating meta descriptions for SEO, and publishing — all from a single conversation. It works with Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini AI, or any other AI tool that supports MCP.

= How do I connect Semrush, DataForSEO, Google Analytics, and Google Search Console? =

Go to **Easy MCP AI → External Data**. Each service has its own section:

* **Semrush** — paste your API key, click Test, then toggle the 13 keyword research and SEO tools you want enabled.
* **DataForSEO** — enter your account login + API password, click Test, then enable the 8 DFS tools including on-page SEO audits and SERP tools.
* **Google Analytics 4** — upload a Google Cloud service-account JSON, set the default GA4 property id.
* **Google Search Console** — upload a service-account JSON, set the default site URL.

All credentials are stored AES-256-GCM encrypted with per-provider HKDF-derived keys. Nothing is sent to any third party until an AI actually calls a tool that needs it.

= Does this plugin send my content to OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google? =

**No.** Easy MCP AI does not call any AI provider. The flow is the opposite: your AI assistant (Claude by Anthropic, ChatGPT by OpenAI, etc.) calls **your** WordPress site, and the plugin executes whatever tool the AI requested. Your content only leaves your server in the response that goes back to the AI client you connected — never to a third party you didn't choose. Outbound connections to Semrush / DataForSEO / Google APIs only happen if you explicitly configure those credentials, and they only receive the per-call parameters (keywords, target URLs, date ranges) — not your post content.

= How does authentication work? =

Two options, both production-grade:

1. **OAuth 2.0/2.1 one-click connect** (recommended) — open your AI client, paste your MCP URL, sign in to WordPress, approve the consent screen. Done.
2. **Manual Bearer token** — create a token under **Easy MCP AI → API Tokens**, paste it into your AI client.

Under the hood, every token (OAuth or Bearer) is SHA-256 hashed before being saved — the raw value is never stored and cannot be recovered after creation.

= How does OAuth 2.0/2.1 one-click connect work? =

Skip the copy-paste. In a supported client like Claude Desktop or Cursor, paste your MCP URL, sign in to WordPress, tick the permission categories (Read / Write per content type, GA4, Google Search Console, Semrush, etc.) on the consent screen, and click Approve. The client receives a short-lived access token plus a rotating refresh token, and you can revoke it anytime from the admin.

Under the hood the plugin implements the full OAuth 2.1 spec: PKCE (S256), RFC 7591 Dynamic Client Registration, refresh-token reuse detection (RFC 9700), RFC 8707 audience binding, RFC 8414 and RFC 9728 discovery endpoints, and RFC 7009 revocation. No AI client ever sees your WordPress password.

= Do I need to enable OAuth? =

No configuration required — OAuth 2.0/2.1 endpoints are live as soon as the plugin is activated. You can manage registered clients and revoke per-user grants under **Easy MCP AI → API Token & OAuth → OAuth** tab. Bearer tokens continue to work alongside OAuth for power users and automation.

= Can I control what the AI is allowed to do? =

Yes, fully. Each token has its own permission set — you choose exactly which of the 214 tools it can call. Create a read-only token for a summarization AI, a content-only token for your AI writing assistant, and a full-access token for your trusted automation workflows.

= Can I limit which posts or pages the AI can edit? =

Permissions are enforced at the **WordPress capability level**, not per-post. Easy MCP AI runs every tool call as the WordPress user the token is bound to, so the AI inherits exactly that user's `edit_posts` / `edit_others_posts` / `publish_posts` caps. If you want an AI restricted to, say, drafts only, create a dedicated low-privilege WordPress user (Contributor or Author) and bind the token to that user. Additionally, the **Force Draft** setting under Settings forces every create operation to draft status regardless of the AI's request.

= How do I revoke access for an AI client? =

For OAuth-connected clients, go to **Easy MCP AI → API Token & OAuth → OAuth** and click Revoke next to the grant — the client immediately loses access and any active refresh tokens are invalidated. For Bearer tokens, go to **Easy MCP AI → API Tokens** and delete the token. Either action is instant and irreversible.

= Where can I see a history of every AI action? =

Go to **Easy MCP AI → Audit Log**. Every tool call is recorded in the user activity log with the token used, the tool name, the arguments, the result, the client IP, and a timestamp. The audit trail is paginated and searchable, and retention is configurable under Settings (default 30 days, after which old rows are auto-purged).

= Will the AI publish posts automatically? =

Only if you let it. By default, the AI can create posts in whatever status it asks for (draft, publish, etc.) — but you can flip the **Force Draft on Create** setting under **Easy MCP AI → Settings** and every newly created post or page will be forced to `draft` regardless of what the AI requested. Combine that with a Contributor-level WordPress user for the AI to require human review before anything goes live.

= Is it safe to run on a live site? =

Yes — Easy MCP AI is built for production. Every request is authenticated (OAuth 2.0/2.1 or Bearer), capability-checked against WordPress core permissions, rate-limited (default 60 req/min per token, configurable), and recorded in the audit trail. You can additionally restrict the endpoint to specific IP addresses, force all created content to draft, disable specific tools globally, and bind tokens to low-privilege WordPress users. The plugin only requires HTTPS for OAuth flows — bearer-token access is allowed over HTTP for local development but should never be exposed that way on a live site.

= Does it work with WordPress multisite? =

Yes. Easy MCP AI runs per-site on a multisite network — each subsite has its own MCP endpoint, its own tokens, and its own audit log. Network-scoped operations (network options, sitewide plugin/theme activation) are additionally gated on Super Admin + `manage_network_options` / `manage_network_plugins` capabilities, so a per-site admin token cannot reach network-level state.

= Can I use this on localhost or a staging site? =

Yes. On loopback addresses (`127.0.0.1`, `::1`) the OAuth HTTPS requirement is automatically relaxed so you can test against `http://localhost`. For non-loopback dev setups behind a reverse proxy that terminates TLS elsewhere, add `define('EASY_MCP_AI_OAUTH_ALLOW_HTTP', true);` to `wp-config.php`. **Never set that flag on a production site.** Bearer-token access works over HTTP without any flag, but again, only for dev.

= Does it work with custom post types and Gutenberg blocks? =

Yes to both. The post and page tools accept a `post_type` parameter so your AI can work with any registered CPT on your site (`wp_list_cpt_items`, `wp_create_cpt_item`, etc.). For Gutenberg, there are dedicated tools for AI blocks and reusable blocks (`wp_list_blocks`, `wp_create_block`, `wp_update_block`) and block templates (`wp_list_templates`, `wp_get_template`, `wp_update_template`), plus full global styles support (`wp_get_global_styles`, `wp_update_global_styles`).

= Can I connect multiple AI assistants at once? =

Yes. Create one token (or one OAuth grant) per assistant. Each tracks its own usage, has its own scoped permissions, and is logged independently in the user activity log — so you can see exactly which AI did what.

= What WordPress and PHP versions are required? =

WordPress 6.0+ and PHP 7.4+. PHP 8.0 or higher is recommended. WordPress 6.9+ unlocks the Abilities API auto-discovery feature, which exposes any Abilities-compatible plugin as MCP tools with no extra code.

= Does this require Node.js or a special server? =

No long-running processes, no Node.js, no Docker. The plugin runs entirely inside WordPress as a normal PHP plugin. The plugin contacts external services (Semrush, DataForSEO, Google Analytics 4, Google Search Console) only if you explicitly add those third-party account credentials under **Easy MCP AI → External Data** — see the External services section above. Out of the box, nothing leaves your server.

= Why does the endpoint return 404 or 401 Unauthorized? =

* **404 Not Found** — go to **Settings → Permalinks** in WordPress admin and click **Save Changes** to flush rewrite rules. Pretty permalinks must be enabled.
* **401 Unauthorized** — double-check the Bearer token in your AI client matches one shown under **Easy MCP AI → API Tokens** (tokens are only shown once at creation — if you lost it, delete and recreate). For OAuth clients, try disconnecting and re-approving the connector. Also confirm your `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header is being sent (some reverse proxies strip it).

= Where do I report security bugs found in this plugin? =

== Changelog ==

= 2.0.0 =
* **Phase 3 — AEO (Answer Engine Optimisation):** 3 new tools — `wp_get_faq_blocks` (extract all FAQ/Q&A blocks from a post), `wp_create_faq_block` (append a FAQPage-schema-ready block + JSON-LD in one call), `wp_audit_answer_readiness` (score posts on featured-snippet signals: direct opening answer, question headings, FAQ content, bullet lists)
* **Phase 4 — E-E-A-T / HEO (Human Experience Optimisation):** 4 new tools — `wp_get_eeat_signals` (full per-post E-E-A-T audit with scores across Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness), `wp_get_content_freshness` (list stale posts not updated within N days), `wp_get_internal_links` (list all internal links in a post with resolved titles/IDs), `wp_suggest_internal_links` (find related posts to link to or from, scored by topic overlap)
* **Phase 5 — Reporting & Aggregation:** 2 new tools — `wp_seo_audit_site` (master site-wide audit: schema coverage %, stale count, E-E-A-T distribution, AEO/GEO readiness, top issues, prioritised fix list), `wp_content_gap_report` (compare target topics against existing posts to surface uncovered areas)
* Total tool count: **233**
* No breaking changes. New tool directories `aeo/`, `eeat/`, `reporting/` are loaded automatically.

= 1.9.2 =
* Added GitHub auto-updater — "Check for Updates" link on the Plugins page; one-click update from GitHub releases
* Added wp-content filesystem tools: `wp_list_wp_content`, `wp_get_wp_content_file` — read any file under wp-content/

= 1.9.1 =
* Added wp-content filesystem tools — list and read files in any directory under wp-content/

= 1.9.0 =
* **Phase 2 — GEO (Generative Engine Optimisation):** 4 new tools — `wp_get_llms_txt`, `wp_update_llms_txt`, `wp_get_entity_context`, `wp_audit_geo_readiness`

= 1.7.2 =
* Fixed: AI connections that dropped when an access token expired now reconnect on their own instead of silently failing — your AI client refreshes its login and keeps working.
* Fixed: posts and pages created or edited by AI no longer corrupt Gutenberg blocks that contain special characters (such as `&` in block settings), which previously caused the editor's "this block contains unexpected content" recovery prompt.
* Improved: added no-cache headers to MCP responses so a CDN or server cache can't serve a stale "not authorized" response to a valid request.

= 1.7.1 =
* Fixed: enabling a plugin-provided ability on the **Abilities** page now sticks — previously, after saving, every ability except the built-in core ones could vanish from the list and fail to turn into a tool. They now stay enabled and become usable AI tools as expected.
* Fixed: the OAuth consent screen now lists abilities from all your plugins, not just the built-in core ones — so you can grant an AI client access to a specific plugin's abilities when connecting.

= 1.7.0 =
* New **Change History** page — see every change your AI made to posts, media, users, comments, WooCommerce, and more, with before/after snapshots and one-click diff
* Ask your AI "what did you change last week?" — 3 new tools (`wp_history_list`, `wp_history_get`, `wp_history_diff`) let any AI client query its own change history

* Security and OAuth hardening across the board
* Tool count is now 214

= 1.6.9 =
